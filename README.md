# SSD1306_keyboard
OLED 0.96" I2C Library to emulate a virtual mini keyboard on an ESP32/ESP8266 (maybe others / tell me) 
With schematic diagram

Version 0.8 beta

Free for non commercial use. For commercial use, ask, can be free also but just tell me.

This keyboard is working in CAPS with 3 buttons (digital)
It would be wonderfull if someone has time to activate the shift fonction and add lowercase chars.
I will modify the library soon to adapt to a digital 5w joystock and a 5 buttons analog joystick

Have fun :)
